      David Lao has been involved with Chi Alpha as a staff since Fall 2014 and
      has recently completed Chi Alpha’s Campus Missionary In-Training (CMIT)
      internship at NC State for the 2017-2018 school year. David is originally
      from Albemarle, NC, a small city close to Charlotte. He graduated from
      UNC-Chapel Hill in 2012 with a BA in Math, and to this day people still
      ask him how exams are going. David loves to hear testimonies that
      demonstrates God’s love, and he looks forward to seeing more people
      experience God’s presence and come to know Christ as Lord and Savior.


      He loves to eat and values a fit lifestyle. He has a way of making other people laugh, or at least finds himself the source of laughter. He also enjoys playing Nintendo video games and watching anime.

      Seth grew up in the rural mountains of southwest VA. He studied Business
      Administration at The University of Virginia’s College at Wise and

      Seth completed his internship with Chi Alpha at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville in 2013 and served on staff for 2 years. During those 2 years, he also served as Chi Alpha Interim Director at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.\

  - name: Brooke Collins
    biography: >-
      Brooke was born and raised in the plains of Kansas and will always have a
      soft spot for the Sunflower State. She attended Central Bible College (now
      Evangel University) and earned a B.A. in Preaching and Evangelism. Which
      means she loves public speaking and finding ways to help people connect
      with God. She has worked with Chi Alpha at Georgetown University, the
      University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Yale
      University prior to coming to UNC-Chapel Hill.\

      \

      Somewhere along the way she met Seth and they got married in 2014. Most of their major relationship milestones have occurred at Chi Alpha events. You should ask her about how they met. Brooke loves watching movies and reading Wonder Woman comic books. She’s also a big baseball fan. One of her life goals is to see a game at every MLB ballpark.
