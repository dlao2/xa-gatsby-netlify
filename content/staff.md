      Reverend Brooke was born and raised in the plains of Kansas and will
      always have a soft spot for the Sunflower State. She attended Central
      Bible College (now Evangel University) and earned a B.A. in Preaching and
      Evangelism. Which means she loves public speaking and finding ways to help
      people connect with God. She has worked with Chi Alpha at Georgetown
      University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University,
      and Yale University prior to coming to UNC-Chapel Hill.\

      Somewhere along the way she met Seth and they got married in 2014. Most of their major relationship milestones have occurred at Chi Alpha events. You should ask her about how they met. Brooke loves watching movies and reading Wonder Woman comic books. She’s also a big baseball fan. One of her life goals is to see a game at every MLB ballpark.
