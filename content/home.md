    Life Groups are where we get together in small groups in dorms around campus
    every week to talk about anything and everything as we try to figure out how
    to do life together.


    We believe that the Bible is the word of God and we are going to look at it to see how it applies to our lives. We encourage and invite questions as we figure it out together.
