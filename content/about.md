    Our beliefs can be described as Orthodox, Evangelical, and Pentecostal.


    By orthodox, we mean that we affirm the historic declarations of the Christian faith: specifically the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed.

    By Pentecostal, we mean that we believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit includes miracles, and this is an important part of the life of the church.
