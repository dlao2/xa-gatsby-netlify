    biography: On campus as a first year, I was starting to make a few friends here
      and there in different classes and clubs I was trying out, but I only hung
      out with those people IN those clubs and classes. Very rarely did those
      people ask me to hang out with them afterwards, much less return my
      food/hangout invites. I was looking at campus ministries, and when I came
      to the Chi Alpha Family Group, I was quickly and warmly welcomed by
      several friendly faces, who asked me about me and as much as I wanted to
      ask them about them. It meant so much to me; the genuinely interested
      expressions given by people who wanted to talk to me, and cared about what
      I thought, though they had only known me a few minutes. I was soon invited
      to have lunch with them and to come to a game/food night, and asked if I
      would give them my number. The difference might seem insignificant, but
      the simple switch in my life from being the one asking others to hang out
      to being asked to hang out really made me feel wanted, feel welcome. God
      works much in the same way – he always and forever invites us to talk to
      him, and desires that we walk closer to him. Chi Alpha members emulate so
      well the boldness and vulnerability that God exudes towards us, and I pray
      always that I’ll be able to show God’s love for everyone to other new
      faces on campus in this way.

    biography: At first, UNC was my opportunity to bury my issues from high school.
      No one knew the bitterness I still held, and frankly, no one cared. Things
      changed fast, though, when God stepped in! Through His guidance and my
      awesome friends in Chi Alpha, I’ve overcome and found my true worth in God
      alone. His goodness extends to all, and none more so than when we need Him
      most. God is doing incredible things through Chi Alpha; come join us and
      see!
